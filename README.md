# AngularEs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.

## University Test Project
#
This project was carried out for the Web Development Course
at the Hof University of Applied Sciences for semester 2 bachelor degree students.
Task:
Develop and implement a bootstrap-based
HTML5/JavaScript/jQuery/AngularJS single page web application, which
contains at least the following HTML 5 elements: header, footer, nav,
and section.
Implement the following features:
a) Show a 8x8 chessboard with two kings and two pawns, a white and a black
respectively.
b) The kings and pawns should be able to move, mouse drag and drop,
following valid chess rules.
c) Use external jQuery and JavaScript files.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
